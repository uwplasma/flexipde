"""
Base classes for discretisation schemes.

The :class:`BaseDifferentiator` defines the minimal interface for
discretisation methods used by flexipde.  All differentiators take a
grid as input and provide methods to compute gradients, divergences and
Laplacians of scalar or vector fields.

By adhering to this interface, different schemes (spectral, finite
difference, finite element) can be swapped at runtime without
modifying the highâ€‘level model or solver code.
