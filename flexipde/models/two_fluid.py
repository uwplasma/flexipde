r"""Two‑fluid plasma model (simplified).

This module provides a minimal two‑fluid model where ion and electron
density fields advect independently at prescribed velocities.  In a real
plasma the two fluids are coupled through charge neutrality, electric
fields and collisions; here we omit these effects for clarity and
demonstration of the framework.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid:
        The spatial grid (one or more dimensions).
    diff:
        The spatial discretiser.
    velocities:
        A sequence of two sequences; the first for ions and the second for
        electrons.  Each inner sequence has length equal to the number of
        spatial dimensions and specifies the constant advection velocity.
