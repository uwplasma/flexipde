r"""Resistive MHD example model.

This class implements a very simple 1D resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
system.  It is **not** a complete MHD solver but serves as a demonstration
of how to include additional physics such as resistivity.  The equations
are a reduced form of the induction and momentum equations:

.. math::

    \partial_t v_y &= \frac{d B_y}{d x},\\
    \partial_t B_y &= \frac{d v_y}{d x} + \eta \nabla^2 B_y,

where ``Î·`` is the resistivity.  A constant background field and density
are implicitly set to one.
